          <h2> A Lotta Bit About Me </h2>
          <p> I moved around a bit as a kid - my dad was in the Army - I think it made me a very adaptable person. I like to roll with things as they come but in a structured way through planning and common sense. I learned my first bit of code over 10 years ago but when I went to college I chose Criminal Justice over Computer Science. I graduated as an Advertising major (I went through a lot of major changes) with minors in Criminal Justice and Psychology. I took a bunch of Art History classes and loved them so much that I interned at a gallery just for fun and I actually went back to code as an intern at a web design company for a summer. That was probably when I realized that I should have stuck to coding and just become a front-end developer. It was the best way for me to combine visual beauty, written words, and logical proccess in one place. I messed up. </p>
          <p> Things happened: I moved to Korea to teach English, when I came back I worked as a freelancer doing odd jobs (nanny, model, brand ambassador, video assistant) and traveled, and eventually got a job in marketing. I worked there for two years and had my soul sucked from me. The work itself was fine and I really enjoyed some of it - part of it involved working with code! - but I felt so crippled by college loans that I felt obligated to stay somewhere that made me truly miserable. </p>
          <h3> I did something crazy. </h3>
          <p> I quit my job. <br /> My boyfriend was moving for med school so I quit and left with him. I have no plan and no idea what I'm doing but I'm going for it.</p>
          <p> So here I am. Taking as many coding courses I can find to refine my skills and working on my portfolio in hopes of making this work. This is the craziest thing I've ever done but I'm pretty committed at this point and strangely exited about it. </p>
          <p> That's my life story. Let me tell the world yours. </p>

          <h2> Doing The Things </h2>
          <p> I try and do all the things but these are some of the things I'm best at:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML + CSS + Bootstrap </li>
            <li>Wordpress </li>
            <li>Graphic Design </li>
            <li>Copywriting (web copy, blogs, articles, I just like writing) </li>
            <li>Layouts + Wireframing </li>
            <li>Javascript </li>
            <li>Responsive Web Design </li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2> Off-Time Things</h2>
          <p> When I'm not working or furthering my skills I enjoy doing pretty much everything! I make it a point to never be bored - the world offers us so much to do! I love playing bored games, video games (all games really), going to the beach or anything to do with water, cooking, and playing with anything fuzzy and on four legs. Things are even more fun when I get to do them with my friends!</p>
